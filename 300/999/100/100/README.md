# 100 - Define Your Vision and Hypotheses

**Use Case**: Music

* **Information gathered**: Initial hypothesis that users want better ways to discover new music based on their tastes.

* **Tools**: 

  - [NotePlan](https://app.noteplan.co/) (for organizing thoughts and hypotheses): for documenting assumptions that current music platforms have limited personalization. 
  - [StoriesOnBoard](https://storiesonboard.com/) (for visual mapping of business model canvas): for visualizing different user personas (casual listeners, audiophiles, etc.).
  - [Flowlu](https://www.flowlu.com/) (for project planning and hypothesis documentation): ...

## Step-by-Step Process for "Define your vision and hypotheses" with NotePlan and StoriesOnBoard

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to effectively define your vision and hypotheses for a music app using the specified tools:

### 1. Initial Vision Documentation in NotePlan

1. **Create a dedicated project folder** in NotePlan titled "Music App Vision"
   - Use the folder structure feature to keep all related notes organized

2. **Draft a vision statement note**
   - Document the core purpose: "Create a community-driven music discovery platform that helps users break out of their musical comfort zones"
   - Include key differentiators from existing solutions (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
   - Add tags like #vision #core #foundation for easy retrieval

3. **Create a customer personas note**
   - Define 3-5 detailed user personas (e.g., "Maria: The Playlist Curator", "Alex: The Genre Explorer")
   - For each persona, document demographics, behavior patterns, goals, and pain points
   - Use NotePlan's checklist feature to identify which personas are primary vs. secondary

4. **Document assumptions and hypotheses**
   - Create a dedicated note for business hypotheses:
     * "Users are dissatisfied with algorithm-based music recommendations"
     * "Users want more community-driven discovery features"
     * "People are willing to pay for better music discovery tools"
   - For each hypothesis, note current confidence level and validation criteria
   - Link related hypotheses together using NotePlan's internal linking feature

5. **Set up a validation tracking system**
   - Create a dedicated note with a table structure for tracking hypothesis validation
   - Include columns for: Hypothesis ID, Description, Validation Method, Status, Results
   - Use NotePlan's task/checkbox feature to mark which hypotheses need immediate testing

### 2. Visual Mapping in StoriesOnBoard

1. **Create a new product board** titled "Music App Development"
   - Set up your workspace with proper user access and permissions
   - Configure board settings for hypothesis tracking

3. **Build a Business Model Canvas view**
   - Create dedicated sections for:
     * Value propositions (e.g., "Community-curated playlists", "Genre exploration tools")
     * Customer segments (map to personas from NotePlan)
     * Channels (how users will discover and use the app)
     * Revenue streams (subscription tiers, potential partnership opportunities)
     * Key resources, activities, partners, and cost structure

4. **Create a hypothesis map**
   - Set up a dedicated view for hypothesis visualization
   - Organize hypotheses in clusters (User Problem, Solution Fit, Business Model)
   - Use color coding to indicate priority level and validation status
   - Add connections between related hypotheses to show dependencies

5. **Build user journey maps**
   - For each persona, map their current music discovery journey
   - Identify pain points and opportunities along this journey
   - Create a parallel "future state" journey showing how your music app addresses these issues

6. **Develop a feature hypotheses board**
   - Create cards for each proposed feature (e.g., "Social playlist sharing", "Genre exploration tool")
   - Under each feature, list the core hypotheses it addresses
   - Use priority markers to indicate which features should be built first based on hypothesis importance

### 3. Integration and Collaboration Between Tools

1. **Sync documentation between platforms**
   - Export key NotePlan documents as Markdown and attach them to StoriesOnBoard cards
   - Include links to StoriesOnBoard views in NotePlan for easy reference

2. **Set up regular review sessions**
   - Schedule weekly team sessions to review and refine hypotheses
   - Document decisions and changes in both tools to maintain alignment

3. **Create a feedback loop system**
   - Use NotePlan's daily notes feature to capture ongoing insights
   - Update StoriesOnBoard with new findings that affect the visual mapping
   - Ensure changes in one tool are reflected in the other

4. **Establish validation criteria documentation**
   - For each hypothesis in StoriesOnBoard, create detailed validation criteria cards
   - Link these to the corresponding notes in NotePlan where validation methods are detailed

5. **Prepare for transition to testing**
   - Create a "ready for validation" section in both tools
   - Move hypotheses there when they're fully defined and ready for customer testing
   - Include links to testing protocols and expected outcomes

By following this structured approach with NotePlan and StoriesOnBoard, you'll create a comprehensive and well-organized foundation for your music app vision and hypotheses, ensuring all team members have a clear understanding of what needs to be validated before moving forward with development.
