# 200 - Translate User Needs into Product Requirements

**Use Case**: Music

* **Information gathered**: In StoriesOnBoard, you create a user story under the "Audio Control" theme in your roadmap:
- "As a user with a multi-speaker setup, I want to adjust volume levels for each speaker independently, so that I can optimize sound quality for my specific room acoustics."

Acceptance criteria:
- Individual volume controls for each of the 5 standard surround sound channels (FL, FR, C, SL, SR).
- Settings persist between sessions.
- Visual indication of current volume levels for each channel.
- Reset option to return to balanced audio.
